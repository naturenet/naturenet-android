	<string name="step1">You are invited to participate in NatureNet, a research project being conducted by the researchers listed on the bottom of the page
[in consultation with Jim Kravitz, Director of Naturalist Programs at ACES]. In order for us to collect and study the way people are 
using technology like NatureNet, we must have your consent. In simplest terms, we hope you will use a mobile device, multi-touch d
isplay, and website to:
\n\n
&#8226; Take pictures and make observations about the natural world\n
&#8226; Share those observations with other visitors\n
&#8226; Share ideas you have about improving the design of our application\n
&#8226; Comment on the observations and ideas of others.\n
\n
The researchers and other visitors will be able to look at your contributions and comments 
via the tabletop or website, and we may ask you if you are willing to answer a few questions 
(either on paper, by phone, or face to face) about your whole experience.  You may stop participating at any time.
\n\n
A longer version of this consent form is available [at the ACES front desk/from Prof Yeh/Maher/Preece] or [nature-net.org], or you can indicate 
your understanding and willingness to participate in our study by checking off the boxes on the next screen.</string>
